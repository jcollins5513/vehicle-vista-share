inclusion: manual

I am continuing work on my existing project.

Please do the following:

---

## 🧩 Locate `granular-plan.md`

- Open `master-plan.md` and locate the **next unchecked section**.
- Inside the `granular-plan.md` you will navigate to the bottom section to find  
  upcoming tasks to be completed. 
- The granular plan should include:
  - Clear, sequential subtasks
  - Implementation notes or technical considerations
  - Any assumptions needed to proceed
- This section of the file is valid **only for this conversation** and a new section will be created in the next session.

---

**Do not modify `master-plan.md`**.

Only use it to determine the next active module of work.
