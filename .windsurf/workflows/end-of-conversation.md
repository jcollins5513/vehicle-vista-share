description: To end the conversation
---

We are closing this conversation and transitioning to the next session. Please do the following:

---

## ‚úÖ 1. Update `master-plan.md`

- Review the current `granular-plan.md`.
- Mark any completed tasks or entire sections in `master-plan.md` with ‚úÖ.
- Do not alter any structure ‚Äî only mark progress.

---

## üß© 2. Update `granular-plan.md`

- Create a new section in `granular-plan.md` scoped to the **next unchecked section** of `master-plan.md`.
- This new section should include:
  - A clearly labeled header with the section/module name
  - A sequential list of subtasks to be completed in the next conversation
  - Any helpful context or dependency notes

---

## ‚úâÔ∏è 3. Generate Next Conversation Prompt so I have it if I go to a new location. Include it at the end of the granular-plan.md titled "New Conversation Prompt" 

- Provide a clean Windsurf-ready prompt I can use at the start of my next conversation.
- The prompt should:
  - Reference the updated section of `granular-plan.md`
  - Continue work on that part of the project
  - Be formatted clearly for direct reuse

---

This will close the current conversation, preserve all context, and fully prepare the workspace for the next one.
