description: The start of each conversation
---

I am continuing work on my existing project Content Creator.

Please do the following:

---

## ðŸ§© Locate `granular-plan.md`

- Open `master-plan.md` and locate the **next unchecked section**.
- Inside the `granular-plan.md` you will navigate to the bottom section to find upcoming tasks to be completed. 
- The granular plan should include:
  - Clear, sequential subtasks
  - Implementation notes or technical considerations
  - Any assumptions needed to proceed
- This section of the file is valid **only for this conversation** and a new section will be created in the next session.

---

**Do not modify `master-plan.md`**.
Only use it to determine the next active module of work.

This plan sets the scope for todayâ€™s session â€” proceed once section of `granular-plan.md` is created.
