## ðŸ§­ Instructions to Windsurf

### Step 1: Create the `master-plan.md`
- This file will act as the high-level roadmap.
- It must not be changed after creation unless I explicitly instruct you to.
- It defines the core features and structure of the project.

### Step 2: Generate `granular-plan.md`
- Based strictly on the `master-plan.md`.
- Break each task into actionable, session-level steps.
- Use this to track progress only for the current conversation.
- Update it only at the end of the session by checking off completed tasks.
- Do not modify `master-plan.md` when checking off granular items.
