# OpenMP Library Conflict Fix

## üîß Issue Identified
Your background removal was failing due to an OpenMP library conflict on Windows. This is a common issue with Python packages that use Intel's Math Kernel Library (MKL).

**Error Message:**
```
OMP: Error #15: Initializing libiomp5md.dll, but found libiomp5md.dll already initialized.
```

## ‚úÖ Fix Applied
I've automatically applied the following fixes:

### 1. Environment Variables Added
- `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE` - Allows multiple OpenMP runtimes
- `OMP_NUM_THREADS=1` - Limits OpenMP threads to prevent conflicts

### 2. Code Updates
- Updated `BackgroundRemoverService` constructor to set environment variables
- Modified all subprocess calls to pass the environment variables
- Updated test endpoints with the same fix

### 3. Permanent Configuration
Added to your `.env` file:
```
KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE
OMP_NUM_THREADS=1
```

## üöÄ Next Steps

1. **Restart your development server:**
   ```bash
   # Stop your current server (Ctrl+C)
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Test the fix:**
   - Go to `/background-removal` page
   - Click "Test with Image" button
   - Try processing vehicle S141 again

## üìä Expected Results
After restart, you should see:
- ‚úÖ No more OpenMP error messages
- ‚úÖ Background removal completes successfully
- ‚úÖ Processed images appear in your S3 bucket
- ‚úÖ Content creation library shows before/after comparisons

## üîç Alternative Solutions (if needed)
If the issue persists, you can also try:

1. **Reinstall PyTorch with specific version:**
   ```bash
   pip uninstall torch torchvision
   pip install torch torchvision --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu
   ```

2. **Use conda instead of pip:**
   ```bash
   conda install pytorch torchvision cpuonly -c pytorch
   pip install backgroundremover
   ```

3. **Set environment variables system-wide:**
   - Windows: Add to System Environment Variables
   - Or add to your shell profile

The fix I've applied should resolve the issue immediately after restarting your development server!
