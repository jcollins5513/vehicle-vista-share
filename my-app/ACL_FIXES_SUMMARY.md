# ACL Fixes Summary

## Problem
AWS S3 buckets created after April 2023 have ACLs disabled by default, causing `AccessControlListNotSupported` errors when trying to use `ACL: 'public-read'` in upload commands.

## Solution
Replaced ACL-based public access with bucket policies, which is the modern recommended approach.

## Changes Made

### 1. Removed ACL Parameters
- ✅ `src/lib/s3.ts` - Removed `ACL: 'public-read'` from `uploadBufferToS3()` and `uploadFileToAssets()`
- ✅ `src/app/api/upload-360/route.ts` - Removed `ACL: 'public-read'` from 360 image uploads

### 2. Applied Bucket Policies
- ✅ **Assets Bucket** (`vehicle-vista-assets-us-east-2`) - Applied public read policy
- ✅ **Media Bucket** (`vehicle-vista-media`) - Applied public read policy

### 3. Bucket Policy Details
Both buckets now have this policy for public read access:
```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "PublicReadGetObject",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": "*",
      "Action": "s3:GetObject",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::BUCKET_NAME/*"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Current Status
✅ **Region Issue**: Fixed - Assets bucket now in correct region (`us-east-2`)
✅ **ACL Issue**: Fixed - Removed ACL parameters, using bucket policies instead
✅ **Public Access**: Maintained - Objects are still publicly readable via bucket policies
✅ **Upload Functionality**: Should work without errors

## Test Steps
1. Go to Content Creation page
2. Click "Assets" tab
3. Upload an image file
4. Verify it uploads successfully and appears in the asset library
5. Verify the uploaded image is publicly accessible via its URL

The `AccessControlListNotSupported` errors should now be completely resolved!
