# Asset Upload Test

The assets bucket has been successfully created in the correct region (us-east-2).

## What was fixed:

1. **Region Mismatch**: The original `vehicle-vista-assets` bucket was created in `us-east-1` but your app is configured for `us-east-2`
2. **Solution**: Created a new bucket `vehicle-vista-assets-us-east-2` in the correct region
3. **Enhanced S3 Client**: Updated the S3 client to automatically detect bucket regions and use the appropriate client

## Current Status:

✅ **Media Bucket**: `vehicle-vista-media` (us-east-2) - Working
✅ **Assets Bucket**: `vehicle-vista-assets-us-east-2` (us-east-2) - Working
✅ **Region Detection**: Automatic region detection implemented
✅ **CORS Configuration**: Properly configured for web uploads
✅ **Public Access**: Configured for public read access

## Test Steps:

1. Go to your Content Creation page
2. Click on the "Assets" tab
3. Try uploading an image file
4. Verify it appears in the asset library
5. Try selecting the asset for content creation

The system should now work without the PermanentRedirect errors!
