# Content Creator Updates

## Summary of Changes

### 1. Fixed Processed Images Display
- **Issue**: Content-creator page was only showing the most recent processed images from Redis cache
- **Solution**: Created new API endpoint `/api/processed-images/all` that fetches ALL processed images directly from S3
- **Files Modified**:
  - `src/app/api/processed-images/all/route.ts` (new)
  - `src/app/content-creation/page.tsx` (updated to use new endpoint)

### 2. Added Vehicle-Vista-Assets Bucket Support
- **Issue**: Need a separate bucket for manual asset uploads
- **Solution**: Added support for `vehicle-vista-assets` bucket alongside existing `vehicle-vista-media`
- **Files Modified**:
  - `.env` (added `VEHICLE_ASSETS_BUCKET` variable)
  - `src/lib/s3.ts` (updated to support both buckets)
  - `scripts/create-assets-bucket.js` (new - script to create the bucket)

### 3. Created Asset Management System
- **New Features**:
  - Upload images to assets bucket with categorization
  - Browse and manage uploaded assets
  - Delete assets
  - Search and filter assets by category
- **Files Created**:
  - `src/components/AssetManager.tsx` (new component)
  - `src/app/api/assets/route.ts` (list/delete assets)
  - `src/app/api/assets/upload/route.ts` (upload assets)
  - `src/app/api/assets/test/route.ts` (test S3 connection)

### 4. Enhanced Content Creation Page
- **New Features**:
  - Added "Assets" tab to content creation interface
  - Can now select either vehicle images OR uploaded assets for content creation
  - Integrated asset selection into the content creation workflow
- **Files Modified**:
  - `src/app/content-creation/page.tsx` (added Assets tab and asset selection)

### 5. Added OpenAI Content Generation
- **New Features**:
  - AI-powered content generation using OpenAI API
  - Generates headlines, descriptions, call-to-actions, hashtags, and features
  - Fallback content generation if API fails
- **Files Created**:
  - `src/app/api/content-generation/route.ts` (new)
