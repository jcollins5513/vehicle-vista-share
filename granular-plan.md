### New Conversation Prompt

Let's continue working on the Vehicle Vista customer share feature. Here's what we need to focus on next:

1. **Fix TypeScript and Linting Issues**
   - Resolve TypeScript errors in CustomerPage
   - Clean up unused imports and variables
   - Fix any remaining linting warnings

2. **Enhance CustomerView**
   - Investigate and fix any remaining UI flashing issues
   - Optimize data fetching in CustomerPage to prevent unnecessary re-renders
   - Ensure proper error handling and loading states

3. **Prepare for Share Feature Implementation**
   - Review and finalize the data flow for sharing vehicles
   - Plan the UI for the share button in ShowroomView
   - Document the sharing functionality for future reference

Current status: The basic structure is in place, but we need to stabilize the TypeScript implementation and optimize the data fetching before proceeding with the full share feature implementation. The CustomerView should display a single vehicle with a slideshow and allow browsing other inventory.
