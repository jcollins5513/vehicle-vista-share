# Granular Plan: Customer Share Feature

This plan focuses on completing the customer-facing vehicle sharing feature, including UI implementation, backend logic, and testing.

---

## Phase 1: Foundational Fixes & UI

- [ ] **Task 1: Resolve Type Errors:** Investigate and fix all TypeScript and linting errors in `CustomerPage` to ensure a stable foundation.
- [ ] **Task 2: Add Share Button:** Implement a new 'Share' button or icon within the `ShowroomView` or `InventoryCarousel` component for each vehicle.
- [ ] **Task 3: Share Modal/UI:** On click, the share button should trigger a modal or UI element that displays the unique, shareable link for the selected vehicle.

## Phase 2: End-to-End Functionality & Testing

- [ ] **Task 4: E2E Testing:** Conduct thorough end-to-end testing of the entire sharing flow: from clicking the share button in the showroom to viewing the vehicle on the public `CustomerPage`.
- [ ] **Task 5: Data Fetching Optimization:** Review and optimize the data fetching and state management logic in `CustomerPage` for performance and reliability.
